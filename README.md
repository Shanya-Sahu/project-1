JAVASCRIPT is used in Schedule and Config tab when we click on the Schedule or Config Tab below content will be change, If we click plus icon we can create schedule and then we click on set new schedule button schedule time and date will be updated. & we click on the plus icon on Assignee left section we can put file. In this all I used JS in this webpage.
